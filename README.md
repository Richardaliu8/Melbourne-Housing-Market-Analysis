# Melbourne-Housing-Market-Analysis

Project Overview  
This project applies statistical learning techniques to predict housing prices in Melbourne. By utilizing linear and Lasso regression models, the analysis aims to provide insights into the factors affecting house prices and to predict them accurately using a comprehensive dataset of Melbourne's housing market.  

Features  
Data Exploration and Visualization: Initial analysis involves exploring the Melbourne house dataset through various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationship between different housing features.
Linear Regression Model Development: Development of a linear regression model to predict house prices, including data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing unnecessary columns.  
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the linear regression model using metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and others, split between training and testing datasets to validate the model's performance.  
Regularization with Lasso: Implementation of Lasso regularization to address any potential overfitting in the linear model, comparing its effectiveness against the basic linear model in both training and testing scenarios.  
Out-of-sample Performance Assessment: Independent testing of the models' predictions on a new split of the data, using advanced statistical criteria like AIC, AICc, BIC, and 5-fold cross-validation, followed by a detailed analysis of the true out-of-sample performance based on deviance.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to harness advanced regression techniques and statistical analysis to forecast real estate prices effectively, thereby providing valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and potential homeowners in Melbourne. The project not only aims to build predictive models but also to understand the robustness of these models through rigorous testing and validation procedures.
